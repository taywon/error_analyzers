error_analyzers
===============

This group was created on Novemeber 14 by two analyzer groups merging (groups 2 and 3). 

Group 2 had finished the ETAS model output that they had been working on and Group 3 was still in the process of considering and understanding error. 

The groups are merged to create a function to plot error diagrams for the MDA code.
