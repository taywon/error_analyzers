Update:

Goals: 
	1)Make the Luen Error Diagrams more reproducible
	2)Create Error Diagrams for Teresa's group that are reproducible

Problem: While the error diagrams produce very nice outputs, we need to find a way to make 		the error diagrams more reproducible as we will be uploading our code to ipython notebook. 		Furthermore, we need to find a way create code that could also work with Teresa's group.

Timeline:
	1) Coordinate with our groups to get everyone up to speed
	
	2) Set meeting with combined groups to go over project - November 19
	
	3) Write pseudo code - November 19
	
	4) Write real code - November 21
	
	5) Get feedback from Teresa's group Novemeber - 26
	
	6) Find the area under the curve for the MDA error diagram December 2
